I am interested in the latest trends in the field of creating websites, web applications, blogs, games, etc. As a developer, I focus on UI and UX issues and make sure that the websites run smoothly and are adapted to be displayed on any device. I specialize in JavaScript and other front-end technologies, but in developing my competencies I also focus on server technologies. I approach each project individually. I focus on communication with the customer while finding the best possible solutions. I also have many other interests, one of which is creating electronic music that you can listen to on my SoundCloud."
